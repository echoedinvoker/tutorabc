# **_Correcting Errors_**

## **Greeting**

_Lecturer:_ How are you today?

_me:_ ~~Great day.~~

> This creat is not about me, but day.

_me:_ ~~Good.~~

> need to ask back.

_me:_ I am good, thank you. How about you?

## **Frequency**

_Lecturer:_ How often do you go to the gym?

_me:_ ~~three of a weak~~

_me:_ Three times a week.

## **Use it for**

_me:_ ~~Use it to some book for study~~

> The sentence is too short.

> "Study" is similar to research, not the meaning I want to express.

_me:_ I use printer to print books for learning.

## **Have (a) broken printer**

_Lecturer:_ Have you ever broken a printer?

_me:_ ~~I have broken printer, but it is just too old.~~

_Lecturer:_ What times do you usually finish work?

_me:_ ~~Before six o'clock afternoon.~~

_me:_ I finish around 6pm.

_Jacky:_ ~~Normally, I ... at 7 o'clock pm~~

> normally is not for expressing frequency.

> "o'clock" and "pm" cannot use together.

_Jacky:_ ~~I usually finish work around 7pm.~~

> Lecture's question already have "finish work", so no need to repeat all words.

_Jacky:_ I usually finish around 7pm.

## **Have any tatoos**

_Lecturer:_ Do you have any tatoos?

> "not" should be before a normal verb.

> Forgot be verb and "the" should be before traffic

> Don't query internet for words, just use the simple adj. words like "bad".

# **_Grammar-relative clause_**

## **Purpose**

- We use relative clause to give more information about people or things.

## **Sentense Structure**

- **pronoun... + relative pronoun + relative clause**

## **Example**

- **He**'s the man **that** _loves you._
- **It** was about 6 o'clock **when** _it happened._
- Was **it** you **who** _spilled coffee on the printer?_
  > Using relative clause to greate a question like above is a very good sentence pattern.

# **_Other Tips_**

- Try to say complete sentences so that the lecturer can correct them.
- The more times I am corrected by the instructor, the more I will gain.
